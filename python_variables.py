# How can we create a variable
# print("Jamie")

# create a variable called name to store users name as a string
name = "Jamie" # declaring string variable
# creating a variable called age to store users age as an int
age = 23 # declaring integer variable
# creating a variable called hourly_wage to store users hourly wage as a float
hourly_wage = 10.50 # declaring float variable
# creating a variable called travel_allowance to store users travel allowance as a float
travel_allowance = 2.4 # declaring float variable
# This series of print statements output the values stored in the given variables
print(name)
print(hourly_wage)
print(travel_allowance)
print(age)

# How can we find out the type of a variable
# We have the type() method in python that gives us the actual data type stored in a variable
print(type(age)) # this returns class int because the data stored in the age variable is an int

# How can we take user data
# We can use a method called input() to get data from the user
name = input("Please enter your name:  ")
# Then we are displaying a welcome message using the name that the user input
print(f"Hi, {name}!")

# Receive data from users
input()
# Display user data on command line
print()
# Save data in a csv file
#openwith()
